# Wordpress Github Action Dispatch
Easily dispatch actions from Wordpress with a button.  Especially great for publishing static sites that use WP as a headless API coupled with something like Gridsome or Gatsby.

## Add all necessary settings in the WP backend

## Activate from the top admin bar
The toolbar will also display a status badge for the most recent action run, displaying status for successful or failed runs and in process or queued runs.
