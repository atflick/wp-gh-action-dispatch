Easily dispatch actions from Wordpress with a button.  Especially great for publishing static sites that use WP as a headless API coupled with something like Gridsome or Gatsby.

== Description ==

Adds a button to the admin toolbar allowing you to dispatch Github action workflows.

Enter all necessary settings securely in the WP backend by clicking on the Action Dispatch option in the left sidebar.

The toolbar will also display a status badge for the most recent action run, displaying status for successful or failed runs and in process or queued runs.
